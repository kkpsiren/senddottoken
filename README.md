## Contracts

This repository includes `contracts/Multisender.sol`, a minimal Solidity contract that enables batch distribution of ETH or ERC-20 tokens. It exposes `disperseEther` and `disperseToken` functions so you can send funds to multiple recipients in a single transaction.

## Deployment

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` for the target network.
3. Run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network custom` to deploy.
4. Copy the printed contract address into `NEXT_PUBLIC_MULTISENDER_ADDRESS` in your `.env` file for the frontend.
