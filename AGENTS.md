# Repository Guidelines

- Use two spaces for indentation in TypeScript, Solidity, and configuration files.
- After making changes run `npm run lint` to ensure the project lints cleanly.
- Also run `npx hardhat compile` to verify Solidity contracts compile.
- Summaries for pull requests should mention any lint or compile results.
